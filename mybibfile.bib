abstract = "Clustering is the task of grouping similar objects into clusters. A prominent and useful class of algorithm is hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) which iteratively agglomerates the closest pair until all data points belong to one cluster. It outputs a dendrogram showing all N levels of agglomerations where N is the number of objects in the dataset. However, \{HAC\} methods have several drawbacks: (1) high time and memory complexities for clustering, and (2) inefficient and inaccurate cluster validation. In this paper we show that these drawbacks can be alleviated by closely studying the dendrogram. Empirical study shows that most \{HAC\} algorithms follow a trend where, except for a number of top levels of the dendrogram, all lower levels agglomerate clusters which are very small in size and close in proximity to other clusters. Methods are proposed that exploit this characteristic to reduce the time and memory complexities significantly and to make validation very efficient and accurate. Analyses and experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method. "

abstract = "Abstract Clustering \{XML\} documents by structure is the task of grouping them by common structural components. Hitherto, this has been accomplished by looking at the occurrence of one preestablished type of structural components in the structures of the \{XML\} documents. However, the a-priori chosen structural components may not be the most appropriate for effective clustering. Moreover, it is likely that the resulting clusters exhibit a certain extent of inner structural inhomogeneity, because of uncaught differences in the structures of the \{XML\} documents, due to further neglected forms of structural components. To overcome these limitations, a new hierarchical approach is proposed, that allows to consider (if necessary) multiple forms of structural components to isolate structurally-homogeneous clusters of \{XML\} documents. At each level of the resulting hierarchy, clusters are divided by considering some type of structural components (unaddressed at the preceding levels), that still differentiate the structures of the \{XML\} documents. Each cluster in the hierarchy is summarized through a novel technique, that provides a clear and differentiated understanding of its structural properties. A comparative evaluation over both real and synthetic \{XML\} data proves that the devised approach outperforms established competitors in effectiveness and scalability. Cluster summarization is also shown to be very representative. "

Three different classification tasks were used as benchmarks: the dichotomous problem of distinguishing common nevi from dysplastic nevi and melanoma, the dichotomous problem of distinguishing melanoma from common and dysplastic nevi, and the trichotomous problem of correctly distinguishing all three classes. Using \{ROC\} analysis to measure the discriminatory power of the methods shows that excellent results for specific classification problems in the domain of pigmented skin lesions can be achieved with machine-learning methods. On both dichotomous and trichotomous tasks, logistic regression, ANNs, and \{SVMs\} performed on about the same level, with k-nearest neighbors and decision trees performing worse. "

Data mining software is one of a number of analytical tools for analyzing data. It allows users to analyze data from many different dimensions or angles, categorize it, and summarize the relationships identified. Weka is a data mining tools. It is contain the many machine leaning algorithms. It is provide the facility to classify our data
through various algorithms. In this paper we are studying the various clustering algorithms. Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of assigning a set of objects into groups (called clusters) so that the objects in the same cluster are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other clusters. Our main aim to show the comparison of the different- different clustering algorithms of weka and find out which algorithm will be most suitable for the users}},

abstract = "In network intrusion detection, anomaly-based approaches in particular suffer from accurate evaluation, comparison, and deployment which originates from the scarcity of adequate datasets. Many such datasets are internal and cannot be shared due to privacy issues, others are heavily anonymized and do not reflect current trends, or they lack certain statistical characteristics. These deficiencies are primarily the reasons why a perfect dataset is yet to exist. Thus, researchers must resort to datasets that are often suboptimal. As network behaviors and patterns change and intrusions evolve, it has very much become necessary to move away from static and one-time datasets toward more dynamically generated datasets which not only reflect the traffic compositions and intrusions of that time, but are also modifiable, extensible, and reproducible. In this paper, a systematic approach to generate the required datasets is introduced to address this need. The underlying notion is based on the concept of profiles which contain detailed descriptions of intrusions and abstract distribution models for applications, protocols, or lower level network entities. Real traces are analyzed to create profiles for agents that generate real traffic for HTTP, SMTP, SSH, IMAP, POP3, and FTP. In this regard, a set of guidelines is established to outline valid datasets, which set the basis for generating profiles. These guidelines are vital for the effectiveness of the dataset in terms of realism, evaluation capabilities, total capture, completeness, and malicious activity. The profiles are then employed in an experiment to generate the desirable dataset in a testbed environment. Various multi-stage attacks scenarios were subsequently carried out to supply the anomalous portion of the dataset. The intent for this dataset is to assist various researchers in acquiring datasets of this kind for testing, evaluation, and comparison purposes, through sharing the generated datasets and profiles.
